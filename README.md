# Riot PHP [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/simivar/riot-php/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=G6N2HQBIM4)](https://codecov.io/gh/simivar/riot-php)
PHP wrapper around Riot Games APIs. 

### Features
- ðŸŽ‰ PSR-18 & PSR-17 compliant - no more dependency on one specific HTTP Client!
- ðŸŽ‰ Dependency-injection first - easy usage with all modern frameworks! 
- ðŸŽ‰ GitHub Actions for Quality Assurance - it just works!
- ðŸŽ‰ Single Responsibility - only API communication inside!

## Getting started
Riot PHP is available via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It does not implement HTTP Client on its own
and uses PSR-17 and PSR-18 abstraction so you are free to choose any HTTP Client you want. 

```
composer require simivar/riot-php symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7
```
